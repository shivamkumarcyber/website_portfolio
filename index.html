                    <p>Password-based authentication is widely utilised in computer security and 
                       privacy applications. According to a Computer World storey, a security team 
                       at a large corporation used a network password cracker and, to their surprise, 
                       cracked around 80% of the employees' passwords in under 30 seconds. To solve the 
                       issues and flaws associated with textual passwords, graphical password authentication
                       techniques were created. So we have developed authentication system using both graphical 
                       and alphanumeric password.This will prevent shoulder surfing and brute forces attack. </ p>

                        <p>From my research one of the papers proposed Enhanced Schmidt-Samoa(ESS) cryptosystem scheme focuses on the issues of
                            Schmidt-Samoa cryptosystem(SSC). Basically this scheme takes four large prime numbers instead of two large prime 
                            numbers in order to counter increasing the time complexity of integer factori- sation and the possibility of brute
                            force attacks and it uses four distinct prime numbers for the generation of a public key and private key. but it has 
                            some issues like security flow and some shortcomings of algorithms so I am going to focus on these issues of Enhanced 
                            Schmidt-Samoa(ESS) cryptosystem.</ p>

                            <p>The project presented a comprehensive exploration of SCADA system vulnerabilities,
                                simulated attacks, and potential threats. It outlined a risk reduction methodology, 
                                emphasizing elapsed time for successful attacks. The outcomes included detailed documentation
                                of vulnerabilities, proof-of-concept exploits, and actionable insights for enhancing SCADA security. 
                                The project's real-world applicability extends to informing policy decisions and shaping industry best 
                                practices. It identified limitations such as cybersecurity risks, interoperability challenges, and human 
                                factors. Future enhancements aim to refine the compromise graph model and develop a user-friendly tool for
                                risk analysis and secure system design, contributing to a more resilient SCADA infrastructure.</ p>

                                    This study analysed the current blockchain research trends in healthcare. The blockchain technology

                                    because of the sensitive nature of data being processed and managed. The purpose of the study was to
                                    determine the present status of blockchain research and implementation in healthcare. To achieve
                                    this objective, we have defined research questions and using the predefined methodology we have
                                    narrowed down the analyzed literature to 15 publications. These were then further analyzed. mainly
                                    between 2014 and 2021.</ p>

                                       Finally we apply Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to recognize the extracted characters. 
                                       The detected texts are stored in the database, further which they are sorted and made available
